# CO2-Smog-Emission-Classification
The given set of codes explore machine learning models for dataset collected from Kaggle by performing classification. 
The dataset is related to fuel consumption ratings in year 2022. The dataset gives fuel consumption ratings and estimated CO2 emission for new light duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. The dataset constitutes of almost 1000 records and 12 columns namely Model Year, Make, Model, Vehicle Class, Engine Size, Cylinders, Transmission, Fuel Type, Fuel Consumption (City (L/100 Km)), Fuel Consumption (Highway (L/100 km)), Fuel Consumption Combine (L/100 Km), Fuel Consumption Combine (mpg), CO2 emission (g/km), CO2 ratings and Smog Ratings. The CO2 and Smog ratings are scaled from 1(worst) to 10 (best).
